# Ai_Translator
In this project, I use JavaScript to handle user input, send it to a translation API (LibreTranslate) using fetch(), wait for the response using async/await, and update the DOM with the translated text. I also handle errors to ensure smooth UX. Event listeners and JSON parsing are key parts of the implementation.
